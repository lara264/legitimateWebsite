      <ol> How to Assess if a Linear Relation Exists
          <ol>
              <li> Make a scatterplot: Does it look linear? </li>
              <li> Make a residual plot </li>
                  
          </ol>
      </ol>
      <ol> Patterns in a residual point
          <ol>
              <li> if it's curved, then the relationship is not linear </li>
              <li> if there is an increasing/decreasing spread, then the predicted y will be less accurate </li>
              <li> inviduals with large residuals are outliers </li>
              <li> individual points that are extreme in the x direction are potentially influential points </li>
          </ol>
