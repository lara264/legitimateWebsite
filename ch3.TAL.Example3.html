  <h2> Evaluating Linear Data Between lnx and lny </h2>
      <h4> Scatterplot Between lnx and lny </h4>
      <img src="xyScatterplot.png" alt="xyScatterplot" style="width: 304px;height:228px;">

          <p> Although the scatterplot between lnx and lny may look linear, one cannot confirm a linear relationship between lnx and lny without looking at the residual plot. </p>

      <h4> Residual Between lnx and residual of lny</h4>
      <img src="xResid.png" alt="xResidualPlot" style="width: 304px;height:228px;">

      <p> Since the residual plot does not follow a pattern and the points are evenly scattered around zero, the residual plot confirms a linear relationship between lnx and lny. </p>
      <p> However, if the residual plot follows a pattern and/or the points are not evenly scattered around zero, the residual plot contradicts a linear relationship between lnx and lny. </p>
