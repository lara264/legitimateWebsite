    <h2> Evaluating Linear Data Between x and y </h2>
        <h4> Scatterplot Between x and y </h4>
        <img src="xyScatterplot.png" alt="xyScatterplot" style="width: 304px;height:228px;">

            <p> Although the scatterplot between x and y may look linear, one cannot confirm a linear relationship between x and y without looking at the residual plot. </p>

        <h4> Residual Between x and residual of y</h4>
        <img src="xResid.png" alt="xResidualPlot" style="width: 304px;height:228px;">

        <p> Since the residual plot does not follow a pattern and the points are evenly scattered around zero, the residual plot confirms a linear relationship between x and y. </p>
        <p> However, if the residual plot follows a pattern and/or the points are not evenly scattered around zero, proceed to step 2. </p>
